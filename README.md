## Abstract
Integrated energy-water-land (EWL) planning has the potential to promote synergies and avoid conflicts in ways that sector-specific planning approaches cannot. Many of the most important decisions that influence emerging EWL nexus conflicts and synergies are implemented by decision makers at regional (e.g., large river basin, electricity grid) and sub-regional (e.g., river sub-basin, irrigation district) scales. However, actual implementation of integrated planning practices at these scales has been relatively limited. Indeed, simply collecting and visualizing data and interconnections across multiple sectors and sub-regions in a single, internally consistent modeling platform is a unique endeavor in many regions. This study introduces and applies a novel approach to linking together multiple sub-regions, and their constituent EWL systems, in a single platform to characterize and visualize EWL resource use, EWL system linkages within and among sub-regions, and the EWL nexus implications of future policies and investments. This integrated sub-regional planning methodology is applied in the Colorado River Basin in southern Argentina, a water-stressed and drought-stricken basin that is facing increasing demands for water-intensive agricultural and fossil fuel commodities. Guided by stakeholders, this study seeks to inform basin planning activities by characterizing and visualizing (1) the current state of EWL resources in the basin, (2) the linkages between sectors, and (3) the EWL nexus implications of planned future agricultural development activities in the basin. Results demonstrate that water scarcity, driven in part by human system demands that have historically reached 60% of total surface water supply, poses a substantial constraint to economic development in the basin. The Colorado basin has the potential to serve as a testbed for crafting novel and generalizable sub-regional EWL planning approaches capable of informing the regional EWL planning dialogue globally.
